### Progress bar (CProgress, CProgressBar)

Bootstrap Vue based Progress Bar components. They work similar to Bootstrap b-progress and b-progress-bar except instead of 'variant' property there is 'color' property which can take both predefined color variants (i.e. success) and standard css values  (i.e. #63C3E3).
